% Input: robot -> A 4-DOF robot encoded as a SerialLink object
%        q_min -> 1x4 vector of minimum angle for each joint
%        q_max -> 1x4 vector of maximum angle for each joint
%        num_samples -> Integer denoting number of samples in PRM
%        num_neighbors -> Integer denoting number of closest neighbors to
%                         consider in PRM
%        link_radius -> Scalar denoting radius of each robot link's
%                       cylindrical body
%        sphere_centers -> Nx3 matrix containing the centers of N spherical
%                          obstacles
%        sphere_radii -> Nx1 vector containing the radii of N spherical
%                        obstacles
% Output: samples -> num_samples x 4 matrix, sampled configurations in the
%                    roadmap (vertices)
%         adjacency -> num_samples x num_samples matrix, the weighted
%                      adjacency matrix denoting edges between roadmap
%                      vertices. adjacency(i,j) == 0 if there is no edge
%                      between vertex i and j; otherwise, its value is the
%                      weight (distance) between the two vertices. For an
%                      undirected graph, the adjacency matrix should be
%                      symmetric: adjacency(i,j) == adjacency(j,i)
