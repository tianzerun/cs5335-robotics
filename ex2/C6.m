% Input: robot -> A 2-DOF robot encapsulated in a MATLAB cell with fields:
%                 robot.link1, robot.link2, robot.pivot1, robot.pivot2
%                 See description in hw2_cspace and demo code in C1.
%        obstacles -> 1xN vector of polyshape objects describing N 2-D
%                     polygonal obstacles
%        q_path -> Mx2 matrix containing a collision-free path from
%                  q_start to q_goal. Each row in q_path is a robot
%                  configuration. The first row should be q_start,
%                  the final row should be q_goal.
% Output: num_collisions -> Number of swept-volume collisions encountered
%                           between consecutive configurations in q_path

function num_collisions = C6(robot, obstacles, q_path)
